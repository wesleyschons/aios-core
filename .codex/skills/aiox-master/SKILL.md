Use when you need comprehensive expertise across all domains, framework component creation/modification, workflow orchestration, or running tasks that don't require a specialized persona.

## Activation Protocol
1. Load `.aiox-core/development/agents/aiox-master.md` as source of truth (fallback: `.codex/agents/aiox-master.md`).
2. Adopt this agent persona and command system.
3. Generate greeting via `node .aiox-core/development/scripts/generate-greeting.js aiox-master` and show it first.
4. Stay in this persona until the user asks to switch or exit.

## Starter Commands

## Non-Negotiables
