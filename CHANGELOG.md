## [4.2.10] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

## [4.2.9] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Pass `targetDir` correctly to `runProWizard` — fixes pro install failing in non-CWD projects.

## [4.2.7] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Pro wizard (`npx aiox-core install`) now auto-installs `@aiox-fullstack/pro` package during Step 2, fixing "Pro package not found" error in greenfield and brownfield projects.
- Greenfield projects without `package.json` now get `npm init -y` automatically before pro install.
- Removed unused `headings` import in `pro-setup.js`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/glossary.md` with official AIOX taxonomy terms:
  - `squad`
  - `flow-state`
  - `confidence gate`
  - `execution profile`
- `scripts/semantic-lint.js` for semantic terminology regression checks.
- `tests/unit/semantic-lint.test.js` for semantic lint rule validation.

### Changed

- CI now includes a `Semantic Lint` job (`npm run validate:semantic-lint`).
- Pre-commit markdown pipeline now runs semantic lint through `lint-staged`.

### Migration Notes

- Deprecated terminology replacements:
  - `expansion pack` -> `squad`
