## Quick Start

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aiox-core.git
cd aiox-core

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm
- Git

## Development Workflow

### Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(agent): add security-auditor agent"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in config loader"
git commit -m "docs: update contribution guide"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR** targeting `main` branch
2. **Automated checks** run (lint, typecheck, test, build)
3. **CodeRabbit review** provides AI-powered feedback
4. **Maintainer review** - at least 1 approval required
5. **Merge** after all checks pass

## Code Review Process

### Automated Checks

When you submit a PR, the following checks run automatically:

| Check          | Description            | Required |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------- |
| **ESLint**     | Code style and quality | Yes      |
| **TypeScript** | Type checking          | Yes      |
| **Jest Tests** | Test suite (Node 18 & 20) | Yes   |
| **Validation Summary** | Aggregate gate  | Yes      |
| **Build**      | Build verification     | No (advisory) |
| **Coverage**   | Coverage reporting     | No (advisory) |

### CodeRabbit AI Review

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) automatically reviews your PR and provides feedback on:

- Code quality and best practices
- Security concerns
- AIOX-specific patterns (agents, tasks, workflows)
- Performance issues

**Severity Levels:**

| Level        | Action Required                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Must fix before merge                    |
| **HIGH**     | Strongly recommended to fix              |
| **MEDIUM**   | Consider fixing or document as tech debt |
| **LOW**      | Optional improvement                     |

**Responding to CodeRabbit:**

- Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues before requesting review
- MEDIUM issues can be documented for follow-up
- LOW issues are informational

### Maintainer Review

After automated checks pass, a maintainer will:

1. Verify changes meet project standards
2. Check for security implications
3. Ensure documentation is updated
4. Approve or request changes

### Merge Requirements

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] At least 1 maintainer approval
- [ ] All conversations resolved
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main

---

## Validation System

AIOX implements a **Defense in Depth** strategy with 3 validation layers:

### Layer 1: Pre-commit (Local)

**Performance:** < 5 seconds

- ESLint with cache
- TypeScript incremental compilation
- IDE sync (auto-stages IDE command files)

### Layer 2: Pre-push (Local)

**Performance:** < 2 seconds

- Story checkbox validation
- Status consistency checks

### Layer 3: CI/CD (Cloud)

**Performance:** 2-5 minutes

- Full lint and type checking
- Complete test suite
- Coverage reporting
- Story validation
- Branch protection rules

---

## Branch Protection & PR Requirements

All changes to `main` must go through a Pull Request. Direct pushes are blocked.

### Required Status Checks

All of these must pass before a PR can be merged:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ESLint** | Code style and quality |
| **TypeScript Type Checking** | No type errors |
| **Jest Tests (Node 18)** | Full test suite on Node 18 |
| **Jest Tests (Node 20)** | Full test suite on Node 20 |
| **Validation Summary** | Aggregate gate |

### PR Review Rules

- **1 approval required** from a CODEOWNERS reviewer
- **Stale reviews are dismissed** when new commits are pushed
- **Conversation resolution required** — all review threads must be resolved
- **CODEOWNERS review required** — changes to critical paths need the designated owner's approval

### CODEOWNERS

Critical paths require approval from `@Pedrovaleriolopez` or `@oalanicolas` (maintainers):

| Path | Why |
|------|-----|
| `.aiox-core/core/orchestration/` | Orchestration layer (MasterOrchestrator, GateEvaluator) |
| `.aiox-core/core/execution/` | Execution engine (WaveExecutor, ParallelExecutor) |
| `packages/` | Installer, CLI, shared libraries |
| `.github/` | CI/CD workflows, branch protection |
| `.aiox-core/core-config.yaml` | Framework configuration |

All other paths require review from any maintainer (`@Pedrovaleriolopez` or `@oalanicolas`).

See [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) for the full ownership map.

### Force Push & Deletions

- **Force push to main:** Blocked
- **Branch deletions:** Blocked
- **Admin bypass:** Disabled (`enforce_admins: true`)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How long does review take?

**A:** We aim for first review within 24-48 hours. Complex changes may take longer.

### Q: Can I contribute without tests?

**A:** Tests are strongly encouraged. For documentation-only changes, tests may not be required.

### Q: What if my PR has conflicts?

**A:** Rebase your branch on latest main:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Q: Can I contribute in Portuguese?

**A:** Yes! We accept PRs in Portuguese. See [CONTRIBUTING-PT](docs/pt/contributing.md).

### Q: How do I become a maintainer?

**A:** Consistent, high-quality contributions over time. Start with small fixes and work up to larger features.

### Q: My CI checks are failing. What do I do?

**A:** Check the GitHub Actions logs:

```bash
gh pr checks  # View PR check status
```

Common fixes:

- Run `npm run lint -- --fix` for style issues
- Run `npm run typecheck` to see type errors
- Ensure tests pass locally before pushing

## Working with Pro

AIOX uses an Open Core model with a private `pro/` git submodule (see [ADR-PRO-001](docs/architecture/adr/adr-pro-001-repository-strategy.md)).

### For Open-Source Contributors

**You do NOT need the pro/ submodule.** The standard clone works perfectly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core.git
cd aiox-core
npm install && npm test  # All tests pass without pro/
```

The `pro/` directory will simply not exist in your clone — this is expected and all features, tests, and CI pass without it.

#### Fork Workflow

When forking and syncing with upstream, **do NOT use `--recurse-submodules`**:

```bash
# Fork via GitHub UI, then clone (without submodules)
git clone https://github.com/<your-fork>/aiox-core.git
cd aiox-core

# Add upstream and sync
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core.git
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Push (use --force-with-lease after rebase)
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

> **Submodule push error?** If you see `remote: fatal: did not receive expected object` when pushing after syncing, it means the `pro/` submodule pointer changed upstream and your fork cannot resolve the private reference.
>
> **If your fork already had a successful push before** (existing submodule pointer):
> ```bash
> git checkout origin/main -- pro
> git commit -m "chore: reset pro submodule pointer for fork"
> git push origin main
> ```
>
> **If this is a new fork** (no previous pro pointer on remote):
> ```bash
> git rm --cached pro
> git commit -m "chore: remove pro submodule reference for fork"
> git push origin main
> ```

You can also suppress submodule noise in `git status` locally (these settings are local-only and do not affect remote pushes):

```bash
git config submodule.pro.ignore all
git config submodule.pro.active false
```

### For Team Members (with Pro Access)

```bash
# Clone with submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core.git

# Or add to existing clone
git submodule update --init pro
```

**Push order:** Always push `pro/` changes first, then `aiox-core`.

### Future: CLI Setup

```bash
# Coming in a future release
aiox setup --pro
```
