# Privacy Policy

## Overview

AIOX (AI-Orchestrated System) is an open-source project maintained by SynkraAI Inc. This privacy policy explains how we handle any data that may be collected when you use Synkra AIOX.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

Synkra AIOX does **NOT** collect:

- Personal identification information
- Usage analytics or telemetry data
- Code or project content from your repositories
- API keys or credentials
- Browsing history or tracking data

### What May Be Collected (Consent-Based)

Synkra AIOX uses a **consent-based telemetry system**. The system is designed as follows:

- **Consent Manager**: A consent management component is initialized by default to handle user preferences
- **No automatic collection**: No data is collected until you explicitly grant consent
- **Default state**: All telemetry consents default to "not granted" (`null` or `false`)
- **Interactive consent**: You will be prompted to grant or deny consent for specific features

If you grant consent, the following may be collected:

- Anonymous crash reports (no personally identifiable information)
- Anonymous usage statistics (feature usage patterns only)
- Performance metrics (anonymized)
- Error reports (for stability improvements)

**To completely disable the consent manager**, set `telemetry.enabled: false` in your configuration:

```javascript
const aiox = new AIOX({
  telemetry: { enabled: false },
});
```

You can also revoke consent at any time through the consent management interface or by deleting the `.aiox/telemetry/` directory.

## Local Data Storage

Synkra AIOX stores some data locally on your machine:

- Configuration files (`.aiox/`, `.aiox-core/`)
- Project status cache (`.aiox/project-status.yaml`)
- Decision logs (`.ai/` directory)
- Story files and documentation

This data never leaves your local machine unless you explicitly share it (e.g., by pushing to a Git repository).

## Third-Party Services

When using Synkra AIOX, you may interact with third-party services:

**Important:** Your interactions with these services are governed by their respective privacy policies. Synkra AIOX does not control or have access to data you share with these services.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Opt-out** of any data collection at any time
- **Delete** all local data by removing the `.aiox/` and `.ai/` directories
- **Inspect** all stored data (it's stored in plain text/YAML format)
- **Request information** about any data collected (if telemetry is enabled)

## Open Source Transparency

As an open-source project, all code is publicly available for inspection:

- Repository: [github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core](https://github.com/SynkraAI/aiox-core)
- No hidden data collection mechanisms
- All configuration options are documented

## Children's Privacy

## Security

We take security seriously:
